# STA5934-Final
Final Project for Statistical Genetics course (STA5934)

Type I Diabetes (T1D) is an autoimmune disease affecting the beta insulin-producing cells in the pancreas. T1D is not well understood and there is no known cure, but there has shown to have a genetic component. Early detection is important in early treatment and prevention of serious medical complications before diagnosis. I conduct a transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS) to identify potential causal genes of T1D, which has never been done before. I utilize one of the largest T1D genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary-statistics publicly available to increase power and apply an existing algorithm, TWAS-FUSION. To provide further evidence for my results, I conduct a fine-mapping method, FOCUS. In my study, I was able to identify a single gene, INPP5B, as likely causal of T1D. The results of my study can motivate future scientific research to better understand the disease and aid in early detection and diagnosis.

The file "Terminal_FUSION-FOCUS.txt" contains my code used to implement the FUSION algorithm and the FOCUS algorithm.

The file "ResultsAnalysis.R" contains the R code used to analysis the results from each of the algorithms.
